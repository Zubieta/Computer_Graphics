Each challenge has a very comprenhensive **PDF** explaining the algorithms used and screenshots of the application *(click on each image to open it)*. The first two challenges were done using **Java's AWT** and **Swing**, whereas from the third challenge on, these were made with **AWT/Swing** and **Processing** *(for the course purposes, no pre-made transformations where used, all were hand coded!)*.

Adding **Processing** into the mix was nice because of its simplified application for interactive sketches and the use of a main *non-blocking event-handling loop*. 

These challenges' codes were made for educational purposes and are licensed under the **MIT License**.

### Challenge 1 - Bresenham Algorithm: Lines & Circles

To further show that the lines and circles are being drawn pixel by pixel, each pixel has been assigned continuous colors to show the iterative drawing, not all in a single stroke.

### Challenge 2 - Line Clipping: Cohen-Sutherland & Liang-Barsky
The lines turn green if they are inside the clipping area. Also the area can be dragged manually!
