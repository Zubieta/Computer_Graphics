#Computer Graphics Weekly Challenges
Each challenge will have a very comprenhensive PDF explaining the algorithms used and screenshots of the application. The first two challenges were done using **Java's AWT** and **Swing**, whereas from the third challenge on, these were made with **AWT/Swing** AND **Processing** *(for the course purposes, no pre-made transformations where used, all were hand coded!)*. Adding Processing into the mix was nice because of its simplified application for interactive sketches and the use of a main non-blocking event-handling *loop*. These challenges' codes were made for educational purposes and are licensed under the **MIT License**. **Click on each image to open the PDF document regarding explanations**. These are just some few examples of what each one of the challenges achieve:
